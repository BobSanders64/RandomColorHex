Have you ever thought to yourself, "man, I really wish I could make this plot a random color so debugging is less boring. "
Well congratulations, you've just found the package for that! Just simply do:

```
import random_color_hex as RCH
Color=RCH.main()
```

And then use that color in your plot!

Alternatively, you can also use the instance method:

```
import random_color_hex as RCH
ColorOne=RCH().mainI()
```

And then use that same color in multiple places!  

Enjoy your daily dose of randomness!
